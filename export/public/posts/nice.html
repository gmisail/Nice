                        <p>

After using Jekyll for a month or so, I decided that I wanted more control over my website. The result of this
was <i>Nice,</i> a static site generator that is not mean. The program is written in Haxe and runs on the Neko VM, however
it can be compiled to support Python or C++ (but Neko is fastest). Posts are written in raw HTML. Why would I do this? I felt
that Markdown and Pug, although very powerful, were too restricting for what I wanted to do. Because my website is mostly applications and games, using
HTML files would not be that big of a deal and would reduce compile times. Each HTML post accepts data in JSON in the header of the file. For example,

<p>
    <code>
        --
        {
            "title": "Nice, a nice static site generator"
        }
        --
    </code>

    <p>
        (by the way, two dashes were used instead of three for this example)
    </p>
</p>

<h5>Basics</h5>

<p>
    When the post is loaded, it separates the JSON data in the header from the post. Nice will generate the page
    based off of the data that you give it. Typically, you will only pass in the title of the article.
</p>

<p>
    Nice customizes and generates HTML code by taking post data and merging that into the body of a layout file. Layout files
    uses a templating language built into Haxe, creatively called <i>haxe.Template</i>. Nice spits out the generated files and 
    assets in the <i>public</i> folder.  
</p>

<h5>Assets</h5>

<p>
    Asset management is fairly simple: all of the files in the assets folder are copied into the assets folder of the generated
    website. This means that everything in your assets folder isn't tampered with and can be accessed in your final project.
</p>

<h5>Stack</h5>

<p>
    The implementation of Nice is in Haxe using no external libraries. Nice uses <i>haxe.Template</i> as the templating
    language. It is compiled to Neko, however it can be recompiled to Python, C++, Java, or Node. Posts are written using plain 
    HTML code and are customized using JSON.
